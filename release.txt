Enhancements
- Display sample counts in matrix sample group labels, mouseovers, and legend.
- Option to toggle a matrix sample group visibility by clicking on the corresponding legend item

Fixes
- Cohort creation in the matrix plot, where sample atttribute mapping is required.
- Allow continuous variables to be added to GDC matrix without breaking. Next will support query of graphql API to retrieve min/max of the variables.
- Sort matrix samples by gene variant hits before grouping, then sort again within each group
- Reenable selecting samples from lollipop view for cohort creation. On the fly aliquote-to-case.case_id conversion is performed on
selected samples, allowing to create GDC cohort; next the conversion will be supported by caching to allow to work with large number of samples.
